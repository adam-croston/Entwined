# OLDLX

This directory uses a version of LX studio from many years ago - but it works, and has all the functional
tree mappings. Work can continue here as we integrate the new LX studio.

# LXStudio-IDE

This directory is the new LX Studio. It is a staging place to see if we can get the new LX Studio working.
